Step 6: Ok now you can run our project. You can register account as customer through signup site. I also have a sample account for customer:
Phone : 0357715583
Password: 123456

Our project only have 1 Admin account. This admin account can create many employee account. This is admin account, login in login as employee
Username: Admin
Password: 123456
After that you can create new employee, and go to register tab in admin website to register an employee account.

Note: - Sometime you run and catch some exception in try-catch. Just continue because this is custom code to check admin or employee. The project still works well.
